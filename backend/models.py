# Create your models here.

'''
For user database model, I will been using user.model from django, for the next reasons: have the data for managing the user easly and freely
also django provides me methods for the actual posting of the information and security parameters, moreover django provides classes who might help
in terms of authentication.

For other database models, I will create its models right below this comments because it is outside other user management and I can connect them
using foreign keys.
